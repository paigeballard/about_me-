  	<h1>Hello, my name is Paige.</h1>
    <img src="images/houstonskyline.png" alt="Houston skyline">
    <p>I'm from Houston and the view in the picture from the sawyer bridge is probably one of my favorites in the city! I work for cPanel, its an automation software company here in Houston. I have been taking some graphic design classes at HCC and finally decided to take it to the next level with DigitalCrafts. I like running, cooking and beer. My first test site was about some of my favorite breweries around town. I'll leave some of that content below.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.saintarnold.com/">Saint Arnolds</a> one of my favorite breweries! Great beer, awesome location with a killer view and good food.
    	<ul>
    		<li>Endeavor</li>
    		<li>New beer Garden</li>
    		<li>Flea Markets</li>
    		<li>Good place to watch sports game</li>
    	</ul>
</p>

	Next up is <a href="https://www.karbachbrewing.com/">Karbach</a> This place got a lot of flack for selling out to the big guys but I still like it. It's close to work and has a great outdoor area for concerts.
</p>
<p>
	Finally there is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/alesatanhouston/">Brash</a> Some of the best beer to me. The brewery is in an old warehouse where they play non stop heavy metal, it's perfect!
